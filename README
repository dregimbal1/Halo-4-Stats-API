##Halo 4 Stats API
**Built using PHP** -  [Demo Here](http://regimbal.me)

I have seen other APIs on the internet but they all required a windows server and were, in my opinion, complicated as hell to configure and get working. This is barely an API.. more of a connection to get you started. The authentication works and data can easily be pulled.

When I have free time I plan to make this all more understandable and cleaner to read. I tried commenting where I could so people can understand. I only take credit for putting in the time to make it. Rest goes to Microsoft for making an awesome game. 

This is built to immediatley connect to 343i and grab stats but the authentication is all the same. You can rip this apart and just get the Microsoft authentication part to build other cool services using PHP.
